I am Ilesh Darji – Have been working as an Automation Test Engineer for few years.

Being test automation engineer – I love automating everything in SDLC from the testing point of view. Especially the tasks those are repeated for hours on regular bases.

Passionate about creating custom tools for team’s productivity and process improvements, building test automation frameworks from scratch and set the test infrastructure, Continuous Integration, Continuous Delivery.

Fan of all sorts of automation technologies e.g. Selenium-WebDriver, Cucumber, Behave, Appium using various programming languages like Ruby, Python and Java.

Recently I have started this blog, just to share my day to day experience in the testing world. That might include technical tutorials for web and mobile automation testing, Dev-Ops, Agile processes and many other topics.
